          <h3>Why aren't candles dropping items?</h3>
          <p>Just as in the vanilla game, you need
            <a href="https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Cube_of_Zoe">Cube of
              Zoe</a> for candles to drop items.</p>
          <h3>Why does generating a seed take so long?</h3>
          <p>It's complicated. It also depends on which platform you're using.
            The best performance is achieved by running the
            <code>randomize</code> utility from command line
            (see <a href="https://github.com/3snowp7im/SotN-Randomizer#cli">
              github repository</a> for info).</p>
          <p>The next best option is using Chrome, which is only slightly
            slower than command line.</p>
          <p>The slowest option tested is Firefox,
            which is often 10x slower than command line or Chrome.</p>
          <h3>Is my seed broken/softlocked/unbeatable?</h3>
          <p>First, be sure to check the spoilers to make sure you're not
            missing anything; randomize your game using the same seed, but with
            "Show spoilers", "Show relic locations", and "Show solutions"
            checked. Read through the relic locations and solutions before
            continuing.</p>
          <p>Usually when people ask this, it's because they randomized a bad
            rip or a disc image that had previously been randomized. The best
            thing to do is to first compare your disc image hash to the
            <a href="http://redump.org/disc/3379/">hash on redump</a>. If you
            don't know how to get the hash of your game, use
            <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha1_checksum.html">
              this tool</a>.</p>
          <p>If you've checked the solutions and verified you're using a
            vanilla rip of the game, you might have found a bug. Please fill
            out the appropriate <a href="https://github.com/3snowp7im/SotN-Randomizer/issues/new/choose">bug
              report template</a>, or post your seed in the <code>#randomizer</code>
            channel in <a href="https://discord.gg/wGMdDRG">The Long Library</a>.</p>
          <h3>Do I need to know any glitches in order to complete a seed?</h3>
          <p>The only time you are expected to perform glitches in order to
            complete a seed is when using the "Glitch" preset.
            Aside from that, no glitches are required.</p>
          <h3>The infinite peanut isn't randomized. Is this on purpose?</h3>
          <p>Yes.</p>
